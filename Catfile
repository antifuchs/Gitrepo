Turns out that many many many tools want config files named after
them. I can't help but think this is a very special form of
narcissism. In this repo, I hope to assemble a repo consisting only of
these files (with the exception of their .lock files if the tool
requires them), and make them do something in an orchestrated fashion
- note that this says "something", not necessarily "something useful".

# To run this (why would you want to do that?)

You'll need VirtualBox 4.2.x (or 4.3, though you will get warnings;
I'm testing on 4.3 and it works fiiiiiine).

Then, run:

``` sh
make fetch happen
```

# TODO

* Capfile
* Dockerfile
* Gruntfile
* Guardfile
* Procfile
* Rakefile

## Done - for "serious"

* Berksfile
* Gemfile
* Makefile
* Vagrantfile

## Done - really not even "serious"

* Catfile

## Exceptions made

Life is full of compromises. There are some files that don't fit into
this naming scheme, no matter how much I try to bend the universe over
backwards:

* `*.lock` because of course
* `.gitignore`
* `README.md` - it's a symlink to Catfile.

# What does this repo even do?

It follows the naming scheme to its gruesome logical conclusion: It
serves the tool's purpose, and not your own. Whatever utility you get
out of each tool is dictated by what each tool thinks you should be
doing. Hence.

1. Make runs "bundle install" and brings up a Vagrant box
2. Vagrant provisions docker
3. Docker brings up a container running Guard
4. Guard launches Foreman
5. Foreman launches two 'yes'es which print "WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO YOURSELF" in a tight loop.

I have no idea what Grunt and Capistrano would do at the moment, but
they'll be busy later, I'm sure.
